    Assets represent datasets or files that DAGs produce or consume.
    This enables data-driven scheduling where DAGs wait for data availability.

    Returns asset information including:
    - uri: Unique identifier for the asset (e.g., s3://bucket/path)

    - created_at: When this asset was first registered
    - updated_at: When this asset was last updated
    - consuming_dags: Which DAGs depend on this asset
    - producing_tasks: Which tasks create/update this asset
